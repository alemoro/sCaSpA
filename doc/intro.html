	<h1>Quick start</h1>
    <a name="app"></a>
    <h2>Starting the application</h2>
    <p>
    The goal of this program is analysing spontaneous calcium spikes in neuronal cultures. Starting the aplication can be done by running the <b>sCaSpA.m</b> file.
	Please make sure that the main application folder is added to the MATLAB path, as well as the dependencies folder.
    </p>
	
	<h2>Import the data</h2>
	<p>
	The data should be organized into one folder containing an equal number of files for the still images (used to manually identify the region of interest) and timelapse recordings.
	For the program it is important that the files are named in a specific way. Currently there are two accepted filename:
	<ul>
		<li>For the still: yymmdd_StillCondition_WellID_fovID. For the timelapse: yymmdd_Condition_WellID_fovID.
		<br>For example, the two files would like 220515_DIC_WellA01_001 and 220515_MyExperiment_WellA01_001.</li>
		<br><br>
		<li>For the still: yymmdd_Condition_Still_WellID_fovID. For the timelapse: yymmdd_Condition_WellID_fovID.
		<br>For example, the two files would like 220515_MyExperiment_DIC_WellA01_001 and 220515_MyExperiment_WellA01_001.</li>
	</ul>
	For both cases it is essential to have 3-4 underscores for the still condition and 3 for the timelapse. This is because the program will automatically link the two sets of images
	based on the <i>date</i> and the <i>WellID</i>. Both <b>nd2</b> and <b>tif</b> files can be open, but only one file type at the time is supported.
	
	<br><br>Once the data is succefully loaded into the interface, the still image and the first frame of the timelapse will appear on the left and right side of the interface.
	Additionally, several interaction buttons will become availabe.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Image navigation</h3>
	<p>
	At this point it is possible to inspect the different FOV without loading the timelapses. If the still condition is a multichannel image, the different channels will be shown
	separately and they are accessibly via the three buttons located below the image.
	</p>
	
	<h2>ROIs Manipulation</h2>
	<h3>Adding ROIs</h3>
	<p>
	Region of interests (ROIs) can be added manually by selecting the <i>"Add ROIs"</i> button locate at the top of the interface. The cursor will show a small crosshair and the ROIs
	can be added by clicking on either of the two images.
	<br>Note that even though it is possible to move between different channels while adding ROIs, <b>it is not recommended</b> due to unpredictable behavior of the interface.
	<br>
	<br>It is possible to automatically detect the ROIs in one or all the FOV by selecting the <i>"Detect ROIs"</i>. The program will then perform a series of thresholds to identify object based
	on the first frame of the timelapse until it reaches the approximate number of ROIs as specified by the <i>"ROIs #"</i> in the ROIs Options on the right side of the interface.
	<br>Note that this functionality is still under development and it is meant as a quick tool to start screening the data, not yet as a final ROI detection.
	<br>
	<br>Alternatively, ROIs can be imported from other platform via the <i>"Import ROIs"</i> button. The program will then ask to select a csv file containing the center
